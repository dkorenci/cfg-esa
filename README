This is cfg_esa - program implementig the algorithm for longest first 
context free grammar compression using enhanced suffix array described in the article:

*** Usage:

"make" produces cfg_esa executable
use "make clean" to clean the build

Running cfg_esa with no parameters will print help message with usage instructions.

The output of the compression consists of all the rules of the compressed grammar 
and the first rule R0 corresponds to the entire string (line [R0]:string).
If the input string is read from a file, use -w option to ignore whitespaces, 
otherwise newlines and other whitespace chars will be included in the string.

scripts/ folder contains bash scripts that can be used for testing, 
usage of the scripts is documented in the code comments

Test cases can be found in: src/test/tests.txt
